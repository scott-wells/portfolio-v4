Moved files. Renamed some components. Started working on the navbar. Made a burger menu for mobile. This was done by adding a toggle onClick and a '.hide' CSS class. Added styled components to get the background image working. Styled hero and navbar for desktop.

Spent the day creating the skills section of the site. Created new icon images, added copy, and styled for mobile and desktop.
