# Scott Wells Portfolio

##### Feb. 6th
Moved files. Renamed some components. Started working on the navbar. Made a burger menu for mobile. This was done by adding a toggle onClick and a '.hide' CSS class. Added styled components to get the background image working. Styled hero and navbar for desktop.

##### Feb. 7th
Spent the day creating the skills section of the site. Created new icon images, added copy, and styled for mobile and desktop.

##### Feb. 9th
My site Google font was loading a split second after the rest of the site. It was noticable and annoying, so I went searching for a way to have it load without artifacting. I found a Gatsby plugin, "gatsby-plugin-google-fonts" that solved this issue.

##### Feb. 10th
Only had time for a little coding this evening. Finished styling a card component. I'm really starting to like CSS Grid. It solves so many problems that I was having with Flexbox. Namely, aligning text and buttons across multiple cards in a row, and making sure everything looks uniform.

##### Feb. 13th
Spent the evening trying to loop through data and pass that data to unique components. (I probably should watch a tutorial, because I'm not passing props the correct way to the component.) It's fine though. The component looks good. Just need to get the correct data into it.
*Edit: Got it working!*
